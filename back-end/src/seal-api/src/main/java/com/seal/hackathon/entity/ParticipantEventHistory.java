/**
 * A frozen, per-participant snapshot of one event's result — deliberately
 * NOT a live reference (no FK to Team, no re-derivation from TeamMember/
 * TeamEventEntry at read time). Written once a participant either leaves
 * their team early (before the event completes, so their result would
 * otherwise be lost when the TeamMember row is hard-deleted) or the event
 * itself completes (for whoever is still on the team then). One row per
 * (user, event), upserted — a coordinator can reopen a COMPLETED event to
 * fix something and complete it again, which should overwrite, not
 * duplicate.
